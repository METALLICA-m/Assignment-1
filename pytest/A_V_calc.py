 This program is strictly my own work. Any material
 beyong course learning materials that is taken from
 the Web or other sources is properly cited, giving

 This program operates as follows,
 

*********
A/V calculator

(Level 0)
Enter Q/q to quit â€“ select either will gracefully close the application and cancel the calculated view option.
Enter V/v to change the calculated view(just the answer) or D/d for default view (equation).

	(Level 1)
    1.	First Area/Volume* calulation
    2.	Second Area/Volume* calculation
    3.	Third Area/Volume* calculation
    4.	Fourth Area/Volume* calculation
    5.	Fifth Area/Volume* calculation

*********

The above menu style (inside the asterix's) is expected, only 2 key entries to use the calculator.

The menu Level 1 , options 1...5 should be modified from the above to reflect the
function you selected.

After selection at level 1, the calculator expects data to entered (use appropiate data types).

(The Level 0 & 1 labels are for indication purpose and are not
to be included)
